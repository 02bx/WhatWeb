.SH NAME
WhatWeb \- web scanner. Identify what websites are running.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Identify content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, stats/analytics
packages, javascript libraries, servers and more. When you visit a website
in your browser the transaction includes many unseen hints about how
the webserver is set up and what software is delivering the webpage.
Some of these hints are obvious, eg. “Powered by XYZ” and others are more
subtle. WhatWeb recognises these hints and reports what it finds.

WhatWeb has over 290 plugins and needs community support to develop more. 
Plugins can identify systems with obvious signs removed by looking for subtle
clues. For example, a WordPress site might remove the tag but the WordPress
plugin also looks for “wp-content” which is less easy to disguise. Plugins
are flexible and can return any datatype, for example plugins can return
version numbers, email addresses, account ID’s and more.

There are both passive and aggressive plugins, passive plugins use information
on the page, in cookies and in the URL to identify the system. A passive
request is as light weight as a simple GET / HTTP/1.1 request. Aggressive
plugins guess URLs and request more files. Plugins are easy to write, you
don’t need to know ruby to make them.
